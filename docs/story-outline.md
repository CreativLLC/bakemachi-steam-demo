# Bakemachi (化け町) — Story & Chapter Outline

## Setting
**Bakemachi** (化け町) — A seemingly ordinary small town in modern-day Japan. Quiet streets, a school, a konbini, a park, a shrine. But something is wrong. People randomly transform into bakemono (monsters) — and almost nobody notices. The town's name literally means "Transforming Town," and that's not a coincidence.

## Protagonist
A **foreign exchange student** who just arrived in Bakemachi. Doesn't speak much Japanese yet (the player's learning curve IS the character's journey). Fish out of water — navigating a new country, a new language, AND supernatural chaos.

## Tone
**Creepy-funny** — Unsettling atmosphere with genuine humor. Something is deeply wrong with this town, but your energetic best friend cracks jokes about it. Think Persona meets Twin Peaks. The mundane and the supernatural coexist uncomfortably.

## Core Cast

### Kenji (健二) — Your Ally
- Energetic, loud, brave, a little reckless
- Your classmate and first real friend in town
- Has been able to see bakemono his whole life — thought he was the only one
- Ecstatic when he discovers you can see them too ("FINALLY someone who believes me!")
- Comic relief but also has a serious side — he's been fighting alone and it's taken a toll
- Teaches you slang and casual Japanese (contrasts with Sensei's formal teaching)

### Sensei (先生) — The Mentor
- Your Japanese teacher at school AND the leader of the bakemono-fighting group
- Calm, wise, knows the town's history deeply
- Runs a small after-school "cultural club" that's actually a cover for the group
- Has been protecting the town for years, but she's getting older and needs help
- Teaches you formal Japanese and the "reveal" technique

### Host Family — The Tanaka Family (田中家)
- **Tanaka Okaasan** (host mom) — Warm, fussy, always cooking. Can't see bakemono.
- **Tanaka Yuu (悠)** — Host sibling (younger, maybe 12). Might be able to see bakemono but hasn't told anyone...? (potential subplot)
- Provide daily life vocabulary practice (meals, household, family terms)

### The Antagonist — ???
- Identity left deliberately vague for now — revealed in Chapter 8
- A human deliberately triggering bakemono transformations
- Hints and red herrings planted from Chapter 3 onward
- Motivation should be sympathetic but misguided (not pure evil)

**Key NPCs**: Tanaka family, Shopkeeper
**Bakemono**: 化けコンビニ店員 (possessed convenience store clerk)
**Story**:
- Arrive by train. Tanaka Okaasan picks you up. She's warm but speaks fast — you catch bits and pieces.
- Explore the town. Everything seems normal and pleasant.
- Go to the konbini to buy snacks. The clerk is friendly. Then their eyes go dark and they *transform*.
- First combat. You win (barely). The clerk snaps back to normal with no memory of it.
- Nobody else saw anything. You think you're losing your mind.
- End: At home, you look out the window. Was that... someone watching from the street?

### Chapter 2: School Days (学校の日々)

**Bakemono**: 化け学生 (possessed student)
**Story**:
- First day of school. Introductions (自己紹介). Sensei is kind but seems to study you carefully.
- Meet Kenji — he's loud, friendly, immediately latches onto you as a friend. Other students think he's weird.
- During lunch break, a student in the hallway transforms. You freeze. Nobody else reacts.
- Kenji grabs your arm: 「見えるの？！」("You can SEE that?!")
- After school, Kenji drags you to the rooftop. Tells you he's been seeing this his whole life. Everyone thinks he's crazy. He's *thrilled* you can see it too.

### Chapter 3: The Secret (秘密)

**Bakemono**: 公園のかげ (park shadow)
**Story**:
- Kenji takes you to the after-school "cultural club." It's just... Sensei, sitting there with tea.
- Sensei drops the act: she knows about the bakemono. She's been fighting them for 20 years.
- Explanation: Bakemachi has always been this way. Most people can't see it. Those who can have a duty to protect the town.
- She teaches you the **investigate → reveal** technique (narrative justification for the combat mechanic).
- Training fight at the park against a shadow bakemono.
- But Sensei is worried: the transformations are happening more often. Something has changed.
- End: At the shrine, you find strange markings that weren't there before.

### Chapter 4: Familiar Strangers (見慣れた他人)

**Grammar**: たい (want to), から/ので (because)
**Maps**: Tanaka house (expanded interior), local restaurant, market street
**Key NPCs**: Tanaka family, restaurant owner, market vendors
**Bakemono**: Possessed restaurant cook (food/cooking themed clues)
**Story**:
- Focus shifts to daily life. Cooking with Okaasan. Shopping at the market. Settling in.
- But small things are off. Tanaka Yuu seems nervous. Asks you odd questions: "Do you ever see things that aren't there?"
- A local restaurant's cook transforms during dinner. You and Kenji handle it.
- Subplot: You notice Yuu drawing pictures of monsters in a notebook. Does he see them too?
- End: Sensei calls an emergency meeting — someone found more markings, near the school this time.

### Chapter 5: The Pattern (パターン)
**Vocab focus**: Locations, directions, describing events, transportation
**Grammar**: ている (ongoing state), location grammar
**Maps**: Town overview map, rooftops, back alleys
**Key NPCs**: Kenji, Sensei, suspicious background NPCs
**Bakemono**: Stronger variants, multiple encounters
**Story**:
- You and Kenji investigate where the transformations have been happening — they're not random.
- You map them out. They form a pattern centered on... somewhere. The shrine? The school?
- More fights. Enemies are getting stronger. Kenji gets hurt (not badly, but it's a wake-up call).
- You spot the shadowy figure again — closer this time. They see you looking and vanish.
- End: Sensei finds old records about the last time transformations escalated like this — 20 years ago. "Something triggered it then, too. I just never found out what."

### Chapter 6: The Festival (祭り)
**Vocab focus**: Festival/event vocabulary, food names, numbers, counting, time
**Grammar**: Conditional (たら), te-form requests
**Maps**: Town square (festival mode), food stalls, festival grounds, fireworks area
**Key NPCs**: Townsfolk, festival-goers, Kenji, Tanaka family
**Bakemono**: Multiple simultaneous transformations (wave combat?)
**Story**:
- The annual Bakemachi Festival. Lanterns, food stalls, games. Everything is beautiful.
- You go with Kenji and the Tanaka family. Fun, lighthearted chapter (calm before the storm).
- Yuu wins a goldfish. Kenji eats too much yakisoba. Okaasan embarrasses you. Normal, happy stuff.
- Then, during the fireworks: MULTIPLE people transform at once. 5, 6, 7 bakemono.
- Chaos. You and Kenji fight desperately. Sensei appears and helps.
- This has NEVER happened before. Mass transformation. Something is very wrong.
- End: In the aftermath, you find one of those strange markings — freshly carved into a festival stall. Someone did this *on purpose*.

### Chapter 7: Suspicion (疑惑)
**Vocab focus**: Opinions, reasoning, evidence, trust/distrust
**Grammar**: と思う (I think), complex sentence structures
**Maps**: School (after hours), library/archives, interrogation-style scenes
**Key NPCs**: Multiple suspects, Kenji, Sensei
**Bakemono**: A bakemono connected to a suspect (misdirection)
**Story**:
- Investigation chapter. Who carved those markings? Who has been at every incident?
- Red herrings. Maybe you suspect a quiet classmate who's always around. Maybe a janitor.
- Kenji wants to confront people directly (his personality). Sensei urges caution.
- You follow a lead that seems solid — and it's WRONG. The person you suspected is innocent.
- The real clue: the markings use a specific kind of calligraphy that only someone trained would know.
- Trust is tested — you and Kenji disagree on what to do next.
- End: Yuu approaches you quietly. "I need to tell you something." (cliffhanger)

### Chapter 8: The Truth (真実)

**Key NPCs**: Antagonist (revealed), Kenji, Sensei, Yuu
**Bakemono**: Antagonist's "guard" bakemono (powerful)
**Story**:
- Yuu reveals what he knows — he CAN see bakemono, and he's seen WHO is making the markings.
- The antagonist is revealed. Their identity should be someone the player has met and maybe trusted.
- Confrontation. The antagonist explains their motivation (sympathetic but misguided):
  - Maybe they lost someone to bakemono and are trying to "control" the transformations
  - Maybe they believe making everyone transform will break the curse permanently
  - Maybe they want to harness the power for protection
- You fight their guard bakemono. Hard fight.
- The antagonist escapes. "You don't understand. I'm trying to SAVE this town."
- End: Sensei reveals she knows more than she let on. The last time this happened... she was involved too.

### Chapter 9: Resolve (決意)
**Vocab focus**: Action verbs, urgency, teamwork vocabulary, complex combat terms
**Grammar**: Potential form (can/able to), volitional (let's)
**Maps**: Corrupted zone (warped version of familiar areas), multiple battle arenas
**Key NPCs**: Full party (Player, Kenji, Sensei), allies
**Bakemono**: Mini-bosses, multiple tough fights in sequence
**Story**:
- The antagonist's plan accelerates. Parts of town are becoming permanently "corrupted" — buildings warped, sky discolored.
- All-out push to stop them. Sensei, Kenji, and you work together.
- Multiple boss fights through corrupted zones (corrupted school, corrupted park, corrupted konbini — revisiting familiar areas in twisted form).
- Kenji has a hero moment. Sensei pushes past her limits.
- You reach the antagonist's final location.
- End: Face to face. "This ends now."

### Chapter 10: Bakemachi (化け町)
**Vocab focus**: Everything combined, N4-level sentences, emotional vocabulary
**Grammar**: All patterns combined, natural conversation
**Maps**: Final arena (corrupted shrine?), then restored town
**Key NPCs**: Antagonist (final form), all allies
**Bakemono**: Final boss
**Story**:
- Final battle. The antagonist has become a bakemono themselves — the strongest one yet.
- Multi-phase fight that tests everything the player has learned.
- The "reveal" here is the most important one: you reveal the antagonist's TRUE identity — not the monster, but the person underneath. You call out to the human inside.
- Resolution: the antagonist is defeated/saved (not killed — this is about understanding, not violence).
- Epilogue: Town returns to mostly normal. Bakemono still appear sometimes — that's just Bakemachi.
- Kenji: "Well, at least it's never boring."
- You choose to stay. This weird town is home now.
- Post-credits tease: Yuu picks up a practice sword. "Teach me?"

## Implementation Notes
- Each chapter needs: 1-2 new maps, 2-4 new NPCs, 1-3 new bakemono enemies, ~60 new vocab words
- Chapters 1-3 reuse existing 62-word vocabulary and 3 enemies
- Maps scale up gradually: Ch1 has 4 small areas, Ch10 has multiple connected areas
- Grammar patterns introduced per chapter match the dialogue complexity
- Boss fights at chapters 3, 6, 8, 10 (escalating difficulty)
